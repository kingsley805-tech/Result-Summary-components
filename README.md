# Result-Summary-components
Frontend Mentor - Results Summary Component
Design preview for the Results Summary Component coding challenge

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thank you for taking part in this front-end coding challenge.

Frontend Mentor challenges are designed to help you improve your coding skills by working on realistic projects.

To complete this challenge, you should have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

The Challenge
Your task is to create a results summary component that closely resembles the provided design. Your goal is to make it look as similar as possible.

You are free to use any tools that you prefer to complete the challenge. If you want to practice using specific tools or techniques, feel free to do so.

The results data is available in a local data.json file, allowing you to dynamically add the results and total score if you choose.

The key requirements for this challenge are as follows:

Create an interface that adapts to different screen sizes to provide an optimal layout for users.
Implement hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
If you need any support during the challenge, feel free to join our Slack community and ask questions in the #help channel.

Where to Find Resources
Your task is to build the project based on the designs provided inside the /design folder. Both mobile and desktop versions of the design are available.

Please note that the designs are in JPG static format. As a result, you'll need to use your best judgment to determine styles such as font-size, padding, and margin.

If you wish to inspect the design in more detail, Sketch and Figma versions are available to PRO members.

All the assets required for this project can be found in the /assets folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

We also provide variable and static font files for the required fonts. You can either link to Google Fonts or host the font files yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

For more details on color palette and fonts, you can refer to the style-guide.md file.

Building Your Project
You are free to use any workflow that suits you. While we provide a suggested process, you're not obligated to follow it:

Start by initializing your project as a public repository on GitHub. Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're unsure how to do this, you can refer to the Try Git resource.
Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will allow you to share your project's URL with others if you need assistance during the challenge. Several recommendations for hosting solutions are provided below.
Examine the designs to plan how you will approach the project. Planning is crucial for creating reusable CSS classes that promote a well-structured design.
Before applying any styles, structure your content with HTML. Starting with HTML can help you focus on creating well-structured content.
Define the base styles for your project, including general content styles like font-family and font-size.
Begin styling from the top of the page and work your way down. Only proceed to the next section when you're satisfied with the area you're working on.
Deploying Your Project
As mentioned earlier, there are various free hosting options available. We recommend the following hosts:

GitHub Pages
Vercel
Netlify
You can use any of these solutions or other trusted providers to host your site. For more information, check our list of recommended and trusted hosting providers.

Creating a Custom README.md
We strongly encourage you to customize this README.md with your own content. We've included a template in the README-template.md file within this starter code.

The template provides guidance on what to include. A custom README will allow you to explain your project and reflect on what you've learned. Please feel free to modify our template as needed.

After adding your information to the template, you can delete this file and rename README-template.md to README.md. This change will make it your repository's primary README file.

Submitting Your Solution
Once you complete your solution, submit it on the platform to share it with the community. You can follow our "Complete guide to submitting solutions" for tips on the submission process.

When seeking feedback on your solution, be specific and detailed in your questions. Clear questions are more likely to receive valuable feedback from other members of the community.

Sharing Your Solution
There are several ways you can share your completed solution:

Share your solution page in the #finished-projects channel on our Slack community.
Tweet your solution to @frontendmentor and mention @frontendmentor. Include the repository and live URLs in your tweet, and we'll be delighted to take a look and share it with others.
Share your solution on other social platforms such as LinkedIn.
Write a blog post about your experience building the project. You can discuss your workflow, technical choices, and provide a code walkthrough. Excellent platforms for writing include dev.to, Hashnode, and CodeNewbie.
We provide templates to help you share your solution once you've submitted it on the platform. Customize them and include specific questions if you're seeking feedback. Clear and precise questions increase your chances of receiving helpful feedback from the community.

Providing Feedback
We genuinely appreciate receiving feedback! We continuously strive to improve our challenges and platform. If you have any comments, please email us at hi[at]frontendmentor[dot]io.

This challenge is entirely free, so please share it with anyone who may find it beneficial for practice.

Enjoy building! ðŸš€
